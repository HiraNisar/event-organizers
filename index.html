                      <p>  
 we believe that all parents -- work-at-home or not -- are invited to daytime school events throughout the year, and deciding when to attend and when to decline school events can be tough. Going to school events definitely gives you an interesting glimpse into your child's world, but work-at-home moms have to, well, work. In fact, some work-at-home moms' schedules may be no more flexible than their counterparts' in the office. So we have such flexible plan to involve both children and parents in your next event.
